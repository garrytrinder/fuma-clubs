      <h1 className="text-primary">SEASON 3 RULES</h1>
      <h2 className="text-secondary">1. SQUAD COMPOSITION</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>
          Each team may register a maximum of 15 outfield players plus 1
          designated permanent goalkeeper. Where a team has a squad of 16
          players, the designated keeper must be confirmed to administration
          before the season starts.{" "}
        </li>
        <li>
          If a team has 15 players or less, the team can register a goalkeeper
          at any point in the season. However, this player can no longer play
          outfield until specified times. Failure to comply will result in 3-0
          loss in all matches this player was used in an outfield position.{" "}
        </li>
        <li>
          The permanent goalkeeper designation can only be changed at the
          midpoint of the season (during transfer window).
        </li>
        <li>
          Any request to change the designated goalkeeper outside this period
          will only be considered in exceptional circumstances, subject to
          captains’ majority vote.
        </li>
      </ol>

        2. LEAGUE RULES (FUMA SETTINGS / BUILD YOUR PRO)
      </h2>
      <h3>2.1 Recording Footage</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>
          The in-game captain of each team must stream or record and upload the
          match, ensuring that the height and weight of every player on the team
          are displayed at some point during the match (half-time is
          recommended). The recording must also include the Match Stats and
          Performances menu of both teams after the end of each game.
        </li>
        <li>
          If a captain fails to show height and weight in the stream, they have
          24 hours to provide this footage.
        </li>
        <li>
          If the heights and weights were not respected, the opposition can
          request a rematch but with a deadline of the end of the match week. If
          the required information is not provided within 24 hours, the
          opposition captain may request a rematch.
        </li>
        <li>
          If a team fails this requirement three times in one season, the team
          will receive a 3-0 forfeit loss for each failure from this point in
          the season.
        </li>
      </ol>
      <h3>2.2. Sharing Team Line Ups:</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>
          Captains must exchange starting line-ups at least 30 minutes before
          kick-off.
        </li>
        <li>
          If a player becomes unavailable within this time, they may be
          replaced, but the opposing captain must be informed before kick-off.
        </li>
      </ol>
      <h3>2.3. Ensuring FUMA Settings:</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>
          Captains may nominate up to 3 players from the opposing team to verify
          their manual settings.
        </li>
        <li>
          Nominated players must record their game and display their controller
          settings in the main menu before kick-off and continue recording for
          the entire match.
        </li>
        <li>
          If requested by the opposing captain within 24 hours of the scheduled
          kick-off, the nominated player must upload the full match recording
          (including settings display) within 48 hours.
        </li>
        <li>
          Failure to comply will allow the opposition team to request a rematch.
        </li>
        <li>
          If a team fails this check three times in a season, the team forfeits
          the match (3-0 loss), and the player may receive a ban.
        </li>
      </ol>
      <h3>2.4 - Lobbed Through Pass</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>
          Lobbed Through Pass behaves as Semi-Assisted (Not Manual) and should
          never be used. However, we understand that mistakes can happen. If a
          team should use a Lobbed Through Pass 3 times or more in one match
          (one leg), the opposition may request a rematch.
        </li>
      </ol>
      <h2 className="text-secondary">3. LEAGUE FORMAT</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>Matchday Frequency: One matchday per week.</li>
        <li>
          Each matchday consists of two games (legs), the home team invites the
          away team to both legs, aggregate score applies.
        </li>
        <li>No extra time.</li>
        <li>Points System: Win = 3 pts, Draw = 1 pt, Loss = 0 pts.</li>
        <li>
          Tiebreakers (if teams finish on equal points): 1st - Goal difference,
          2nd - Goals scored, 3rd - Head-to-head results.
        </li>
        <li>
          Number of Players Required: A minimum of 10 players are required to
          play a league match.
        </li>
        <li>
          If a team has fewer than 10 players, they must use a Joker or forfeit
          the match (3-0 loss).
        </li>
        <li>
          If both teams have fewer than 10 players, the match will be
          rescheduled at the committee&apos;s discretion.
        </li>
      </ol>
      <h3>3.2 Joker Rule (Postponements):</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>
          Each team is allowed two Jokers per season to postpone a scheduled
          match.
        </li>
        <li>The postponed match must be played within 7 days.</li>
        <li>
          Teams cannot play their next scheduled opponent until the postponed
          match is completed, unless it is approved by the committee and all
          involved parties.
        </li>
        <li>
          The Joker should be used only for squad availability issues, not to
          delay for a stronger lineup.
        </li>
      </ol>
      <h3>3.3. Red Card Sanctions:</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>
          A red card results in a temporary in-match suspension (sin bin) but
          does not cause the player to miss the next match.
        </li>
        <li>
          If there is evidence of consistent abuse of this rule, it will be
          subject to review at the midpoint of the season, with potential
          amendments based on captains’ majority decision.
        </li>
      </ol>

      </ul>
      <h2 className="text-secondary">6. FREE AGENTS CONTRIBUTION</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>
          Free players (players without a club) can join a team at any time but
          must be transferred before playing.
        </li>
        <li>
          {" "}
          Once transferred, a player cannot play for another team until the
          transfer window opens.
        </li>
      </ol>
      <h2 className="text-secondary">7. TRANSFERS</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>
          The transfer period is open between seasons and at the midpoint of
          each season.
        </li>
        <li>
          Each team can register a maximum of 15 players (+1 permanent GK).
        </li>
        <li>
          Free agents may join a club at any time, but signed players must wait
          for the transfer window.
        </li>
        <li>
          No player can play for more than two teams per season (with the
          exception of their club forfeiting the league).
        </li>
        <li>
          All transfers must be reported by captains in the transfer channel.
        </li>
        <li>
          If a club withdraws from the league, its players immediately become
          free agents.
        </li>
        <li>
          Teams may sign free agents at any time, provided they do not exceed
          the 15-player limit.
        </li>
        <li>
          If a player leaves a club but does not sign elsewhere, they may rejoin
          their former club at any point in the season, as long as the 15-player
          limit is maintained.
        </li>
        <li>
          Up to 2 players per season can be transfered outside of designated

        </li>
        <li>
          All teams must have a squad size of at least 12 players at all times.

          than 12.
        </li>
      </ol>
      <h2 className="text-secondary">8. MAIN ISSUES AND CONSEQUENCES</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Disconnection: If a player disconnects, the match continues unless
          both captains agree to restart. If an entire team disconnects without
          opponent consent, they will forfeit (3-0 loss).
        </li>
        <li>
          Team Withdrawal: If a team withdraws mid-season, all their results are
          deleted.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        These rules are subject to change at the discretion of the committee.
        Any changes will be communicated to all team captains.
